<p>5 Studies on Productivity That’ll Change Your Life</p>
<p>Warren Buffett once said that “the difference between successful
people and very successful people is that very successful people say
“no” to almost everything.” In which group do you belong – successful
people of very successful people? If you’re like the most of us, the
answer is neither. Luckily, there are many interesting pieces of
research that yield amazing discoveries on how productivity works.</p>
<p>Up next, we’ll look into <strong>5 scientific studies on
productivity</strong> with results that have surprised many <a
href="https://www.scoro.com/time-management-software/">time
management</a> and business coaches. Are you ready to find out what
science has to say about your productivity?</p>
<h2 id="study-1-rewards-work-magic-on-our-motivation">Study 1: Rewards
work magic on our motivation</h2>
<pre><code>奖励自己，其中蕴含这无穷的魔力，联想游戏的奖励机制。</code></pre>
<p>Want to motivate yourself to stay at work for longer hours, hit the
gym more often, or finish all tasks on time? Then you need to hear about
this study.</p>
<p>Researchers Katherine L. Milkman, Julia A. Minson, and Kevin G. M.
Volpp wanted to see whether the right motivation would make college
students visit the gym more often. So they gathered together 226
students who were having trouble going to the gym as often as they would
have liked to. Next, they broke the students into 3 groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Group One</strong> got an iPod loaded with popular
audiobooks. They got it as a 10-week loan and were allowed to only
listen to it in the gym</li>
<li><strong>Group Two</strong> got the audiobooks for free, and they
could load these to their personal iPods. They were encouraged to listen
to the tracks in the gym but could also do it anywhere else.</li>
<li><strong>Group Three</strong> was the control group. They got a gift
certificate and were encouraged to hit the gym more often.</li>
</ul>
<p>The audio novels included cool books such as The Hunger Games
trilogy, the Da Vinci Code trilogy, the Twilight series, etc. – highly
addictive books that are hard to put down.</p>
<pre><code>这里做一个实验，三组人，给予不同的奖励，让他们到体育馆锻炼。第一组，借给他们MP3,里面有精彩的有声书，但是只能在体育馆听；第二组，借给他们IPods,让他们自由获取有声书，但在任何地方都可用；第三组，对照组，当体育馆给他们发放礼券。最后的结果是，第一组100%，第二组29%，第三组51%。由此可见，奖励系统的魔力。最后，询问他们是否会为付费购买IPods时，61%的人表示愿意。</code></pre>
<p><strong>Can you guess which group worked out the most?</strong></p>
<p>It was Group One, the students that got the iPod as a loan and could
only listen to it in the gym. They were a lot more motivated to work out
as they had a reward accessible only while being physically in the gym.
This led the first group to outperform the second one by 29% and the
third one by 51%.</p>
<p><strong>By physically restricting access to the tempting desire, the
students got a 22% boost compared to their average
productivity.</strong></p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Study-results</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The rewarding system worked so well that when asked whether they’d
like to keep paying to use iPods, 61% of the group members said yes.</p>
<p><strong>How to apply the findings to your personal daily
routine:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Find something you love doing (e.g. listening to a new album,
reading online articles, eating chocolate)</li>
<li>Tie the reward with action – you’ll get the good stuff whenever you
finish a task or work on one.</li>
<li>Don’t let yourself have the reward before you’ve completed the
task.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="study-2-a-planned-life-equals-a-happy-life">Study 2: A planned
life equals a happy life</h2>
<p>Daniel Gilbert, the author of <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Stumbling-Happiness-Daniel-Gilbert/dp/1400077427">Stumbling
on Happiness</a>, has said: “A wandering mind is not a happy mind”. We
spend over 45% of our waking hours thinking about multiple tasks at
once. Moreover, we’re unable to focus on the thing we’re doing at the
moment. This kind of mind-wandering can lead to increased unhappiness in
the long term.</p>
<p>To live a happier and more fulfilling life, we need to plan our time
accordingly. A study from the Journal of Happiness Studies discovered
that people who manage their free time have a better quality of
life.</p>
<pre><code>有计划的生活，意味着快乐和充实的生活。管理咸鱼时间可以让生活质量变得更好。</code></pre>
<p><strong>What are the best ways to get the most out of your
time?</strong></p>
<p>In her book <a
href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17847683-what-the-most-successful-people-do-at-work">What
the Most Successful People Do at Work</a>, author Laura Vanderkam wrote,
“preliminary analysis from CEOs in India found that a firm’s sales
increased as the CEO worked more hours. But more intriguingly, the
correlation between CEO time use and output was driven entirely by hours
spent in planned activities. Planning doesn’t have to mean that the
hours are spent in meetings; it’s just that CEO time is a limited and
valuable resource, and planning how it should be allocated increases the
chances that it’s spent in productive ways.”</p>
<p>Vanderkam also <a
href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/24980981-what-the-most-successful-people-do-at-work-a-short-guide-to-making-over">shared
in her book</a> the idea that</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Successful people know that hours, like capital, can be
consciously allocated with the goal of creating riches—in the form of a
changed world, life’s work—overtime.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further, according to <a href="http://calnewport.com/">Cal
Newport</a>, author of Deep Work and the guy behind the Study Hacks
Blog, scheduling every hour of the day is one of the biggest factors of
success. The best way to set up your day for success is to schedule
EVERY SINGLE MINUTE of it.</p>
<p>Every Friday after work or every Monday before starting your week,
take the time to review your to-do list and assign a time period to
each. Planning your days hour-by-hour is beneficial in many ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have a clear task list and know what to do after finishing the
previous task;</li>
<li>Limited time brackets help to finish tasks faster, avoiding
overthinking some little details;</li>
<li>You’ll get so much more work done as you know exactly what tasks
needs to be completed.</li>

<h2
id="study-3-you-can-achieve-any-goal-by-not-doing-these-things">Study 3:
You can achieve ANY goal by NOT doing these things</h2>
<p>Are job-seekers more likely to find work if they visualize themselves
as future CEOs, or question whether they really will attain the ideal
position? A popular guess is that visualizing one’s future success will
lead to higher achievements. In fact, the opposite is true.</p>
<p>Research shows that positive fantasies about future success yield
poor results as they do not generate the energy needed to pursue the
desired goals. Instead, positive dreams have a negative psychological
effect on people, making them indulge in their fantasies and not
focusing on achieving them.</p>
<p>So here’s the verdict: Do not waste time thinking about your future
success and daydreaming of positive fantasies. You also shouldn’t tell
about your goals to other people.</p>
<p>A study conducted by <a
href="http://www.psych.nyu.edu/gollwitzer/86Goll_SpecificIdentities.pdf">Peter
M. Gollwitzer</a> indicated that individuals feel closer to having
achieved their identity goals when their identity-relevant activities
(e.g., getting a promotion) are noticed by others. As you tell other
people about your goals, you’ll feel like you’ve already accomplished
them. This leads to poor work performance and unfinished goals.</p>
<pre><code>正常认知是：对未来幻想越成功，带来的成就就会越高。但真相是与此相反的。研究表明，积极的对未来成功的幻想，并不会给你带来鼓舞，奋进。相反，这会给人带来消极的心理影响，会让人们过多的关注幻想，而不是去怎么实现它。</code></pre>
<p><strong>How to set attainable goals and achieve them?</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Avoid fantasizing about your future success and create an actionable
plan to get to where you want to be.</li>
<li>Keep your goals to yourself. Telling others about your goals
decreases the likelihood of achieving them.</li>
<li>Break a big goal into smaller objectives that are easily completed
and attainable shortly</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Sources:</strong> Positive fantasies about idealized futures

for Specific Identities: The Social Reality of Self-Symbolizing</p>
<pre><code>如何设置可到达的目标并实现它们？避免对未来成功的幻想，制定一个可行的计划来实现目标；将具体目标留在心里，不要告诉他人，告诉他人会让你觉得你已经实现来它；将大目标拆解成无数个容易完成且和实现的短期目标。</code></pre>
<h2 id="study-4-find-your-signature-strengths-and-do-it-fast">Study 4:
Find your “signature strengths” (and do it fast!)</h2>
<p>Want to know how to be more motivated, happy, and productive at work?
Research that examined Americans’ happiness and energy levels found that
when people work on something that they’re good at, they feel happier
and more energetic.</p>
<p>There are many studies showing that “signature strengths” make people
happier.  And why wouldn’t they? Being good at something boosts
confidence and makes the tasks more enjoyable.</p>
<p>According to the research, the more hours per day Americans get to
use their strengths; the less likely they are to report experiencing
worry, stress, anger, sadness, or physical pain. Working on something
that you’re good at raises energy levels and self-confidence, leading to
a happier mood.</p>
<p><strong>The more signature strengths were applied at the workplace,
the more positive experiences the subjects had at work.</strong></p>

alt="Positive-emotions" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Positive-emotions</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The easiest way to feel happier and more driven at work is to find a
job you love. Using your strengths helps to create a flow of work, and
you won’t even notice as the hours pass by while working on tasks.</p>
<p>This study also showed that character strengths matter in vocational
environments irrespective of their content. This means that we should
apply as many of our strengths as possible, regardless of their nature
(strong communication skills, advanced technical knowledge, etc.)</p>
<pre><code>找到自己擅长的事情去做。做自己擅长的事情会增加能量和自信，会带来幸福感。感到幸福以及驱动自己工作的最简单的方法便是找到自己喜欢的工作。</code></pre>
<p><strong>How to make the “signature strengths” work for
you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Find your “signature strengths.” These might be related to your job
or simply things you’re good at, such as communicating with other
people</li>
<li>Create new “signature strengths” by learning a new skill</li>
<li>Be creative about your work tasks and think of new ways to apply
your best skills to every activity at work (make the tasks more like
you)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> When Americans Use Their Strengths More,
They Stress Less</p>
<pre><code>找寻自己的长处，找到自己擅长的工作；通过学习新技能创造新的自己擅长的能力；用新的方式和和想法将自己最擅长的能力应用到工作中的每一方面。</code></pre>
<h2 id="study-5-if-you-cant-eliminate-bad-habits-replace-them">Study 5:
If you can’t eliminate bad habits, replace them</h2>
<p>Studies show that as we decide to quit a bad habit, we’re likely to
indulge in it even more often. Resolving what you would not do in the
future (as opposed to what you would) can lead to a “behavioral ironic
rebound effect.”</p>
<p>A study found that “negation implementation intentions” did,
ironically, strengthen the habit one aimed to break. So simply quitting
a bad habit is not a good choice if you want to get rid of it.</p>
<p>Additionally, the research found that negation implementation
intentions are most likely to result in rebound effects when the habit
to be negated are strong.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what you should do instead:</strong></p>
<p>First, we need to recognize the problem. Up next, we need to find the
source of the bad habit. In many cases, your bad habit is a simple way
to cope with stress. For example, eating chocolate, biting your nails,
etc.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we think a habit is productive while in reality, it’s
making us less energetic and shortening our attention span. Think about
reading emails – it makes us feel connected but distracts us from
serious work.</p>
<p><img
src="https://gitee.com/freheit/Images/raw/master//img/Bad-habits.png"
alt="Bad-habits" /> <strong>To break a bad habit, we need to find a
substitute for it.</strong> You need an alternative action for the time
when boredom or stress kicks in. For example, instead of eating a bar of
chocolate, you could brew yourself a cup of tea.</p>
<p>Whatever your substitute might be, you need a plan of what to do when
feeling like indulging in a bad habit.</p>
<p><strong>More ideas for quitting a bad habit:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cut out all the triggers. Usually, bad habits are triggered by
another action. Learn to avoid these or replace the second act with
something new instead of the old habitual action</li>
<li>Find a partner in crime. It is easier to quit a bad habit if someone
stands beside you and tackles with the same issues</li>
<li>Visualize yourself succeeding – think how great it would feel to
have quit the bad habit. You can do it!</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>想要戒掉一些陋习，不能单方面的戒掉，而是找另一个好习惯来代替。找一个同伴，他和你一样想戒掉同一个陋习，起到彼此监督的作用；想象自己使成功的，自己很棒，自己戒掉来陋习。</code></pre>
